			I’ve been writing an article a week for Odyssey for about six weeks now. So far I’ve been lucky enough to have topics come to me with just a little bit of brainstorming each week, mostly based on what has been on my mind in a given week. This time I’m stuck. I Googled writing prompts, browsed the news, asked a few people and I still didn’t have a solid idea. So I Googled “what to write for my Odyssey article.” I found this gem by Alexa Lisitza. She listed 25 possible article topics for Odyssey articles so here are 25 incredibly short articles for my article this week.

		Most of my closet consists of brand name clothes that come from Plato’s Closet. Stores like Plato’s Closet and Buffalo Exchange buy new and gently used clothes from customers and then sell them for half the retail price. They’re full of hidden gems. If you’re looking for good clothes at a decent price, try Plato’s or Buffalo Exchange. Local thrift shops can be good for fun finds too.

				I have some ideas about the Culper Spies. Way back during the Revolution, George Washington enlisted a ring of spies to pass him information on British movements. They communicated with newspaper messages and invisible ink and went by code names and numbers and even Washington didn’t know most of their identities. The ring stopped operating when hostilities ended but imagine if the Culper Ring had never come to an end.
